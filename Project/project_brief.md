# Project Brief: Breast Cancer Prediction

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to predict the diagnosis of breast masses as either malignant or benign using the provided dataset. This project aims to develop your practical skills in classification tasks, feature analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Project Overview:
In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. Your main tasks are to:

1.	Predict Diagnosis: Build a classification model to accurately predict whether a breast mass is malignant ('M') or benign ('B') based on the features provided.
2.	Feature Analysis: Understand and analyze the features to determine which characteristics of cell nuclei are most indicative of malignancy.
3.	Recommendation : Provide suggestions and recommendations based on your analysis and findings for the firm.

## Dataset Description:
The Breast Cancer Prediction dataset includes the following information for each instance:

1.	ID Number: A unique identifier for each sample.
2.	Diagnosis: The target variable indicating the diagnosis (malignant 'M' or benign 'B').

For each cell nucleus, the following ten real-valued features are computed:

●	Radius: The mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter of the nucleus.
●	Texture: The standard deviation of gray-scale values in the nucleus.
●	Perimeter: The perimeter of the nucleus.
●	Area: The area of the nucleus.
●	Smoothness: A measure of local variation in radius lengths.
●	Compactness: Computed as the square of the perimeter divided by the area minus 1.0.
●	Concavity: Describes the severity of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
●	Concave Points: Represents the number of concave portions of the nucleus contour.
●	Symmetry: Measures the symmetry of the nucleus.
●	Fractal Dimension: Approximates the "coastline" of the nucleus using the concept of fractal geometry.
