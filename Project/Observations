The dataset has 33 columns, including the target variable diagnosis and 32 feature columns. The feature columns seem to be divided into three categories: mean, standard error, and worst values for each of the 10 features (radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension).

Data cleaning
Checked for missing values, dropped Unnamed: 32 column and converted the diagnosis column to a categorical variable.

The output shows the summary statistics for each column in the dataset.

Here are some observations:

The id column has a large range of values, indicating that it's likely a unique identifier for each sample.
The mean values for the radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and area_mean columns are relatively high, indicating that the tumors are generally large.
The standard deviations for these columns are also relatively high, suggesting that there is significant variation in the size of the tumors.
The smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, and concave points_mean columns have lower mean values, indicating that the tumors are generally not very smooth, compact, or concave.
The symmetry_mean column has a higher mean value, indicating that the tumors are generally more symmetric.
The fractal_dimension_mean column has a relatively low mean value, indicating that the tumors have a relatively low fractal dimension.
The worst-case values for each feature (e.g., radius_worst, texture_worst, etc.) have similar patterns to the mean values, but with slightly higher means and standard deviations.
